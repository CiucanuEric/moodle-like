# Moodle - Simplified Educational Platform

This project is a simplified version of the Moodle educational platform, designed to provide core learning management functionalities. Developed using Kotlin, Java, and React, it utilizes Docker, Spring Boot, and Envoy Proxy for a scalable and efficient architecture. The main communication protocol is HTTP, with gRPC used as a secondary protocol for authentication.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure login system using gRPC.
    
-   **Course Management**: Create, edit, and manage educational courses.
    
-   **Assignment Submissions**: Users can submit and track assignments.
    
-   **Scalability**: Docker and Envoy Proxy for containerized deployment.
    
-   **Database Storage**: Efficient data storage with MySQL and MongoDB.
    

## Technologies Used

-   **Kotlin & Java**: Core backend programming languages.
    
-   **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for handling application logic.
    
-   **React**: Frontend framework for a dynamic user interface.
    
-   **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.
    
-   **Envoy Proxy**: Filters HTTP/2 packets from the gRPC module to the React service.
    
-   **gRPC**: Secure and efficient authentication mechanism.
    
-   **MySQL & MongoDB**: Used for structured and unstructured data storage.
